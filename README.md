# Flask-Web-Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing job data from Glassdoor to gain insights into current and emerging job market trends, identify in-demand skills, and understand how employers can improve their branding and reputation to attract and retain top talent. The analysis is conducted using various data visualization techniques, integrated into a web interface using Flask.

Features
1. Data Collection & Extraction: The dataset is collected from Glassdoor and stored in a DB2 database. SQL operations are performed to prepare the data for analysis.
2. Data Preparation: Data modules are created in IBM Cognos Analytics to shape and prepare the data for visualization.
3. Data Visualization: Various types of visualizations are created, including bar charts, line charts, and heat maps, to analyze job trends, salary distributions, and more.
4. Dashboard: A responsive dashboard is designed to display the visualized data in an organized and easy-to-read format.
5. Story Creation: Data stories are created to present the analysis in a narrative format, making the insights more engaging and understandable.
6. Report Generation: Detailed reports are generated to summarize the findings from the data analysis.
7. Web Integration: The dashboard, report, and data stories are embedded into a web interface using Flask.
